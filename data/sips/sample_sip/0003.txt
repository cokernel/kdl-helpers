In Commenmoration of the Founding of the
Massachusetis Bay Colony in the Year 1623.

                    I.

      They who maintained their rights,
        Through storm and stress,
      And walked in all the ways
        That God made known,
      Led by no wandering lights,
        And by no guess,
      Through dark and desolate days
         Of trial and moan:
      Here let their monument
        Rise, like a word
      In rock commemorative
