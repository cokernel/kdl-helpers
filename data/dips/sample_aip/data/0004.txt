

An Ode



  Of our Land's youth;
Of ways the Puritan went,
  With soul love-spurred
To suffer, die, and live
  For faith and truth.
Here they the corner-stone
  Of Freedom laid;
Here in their hearts' distress
  They lit the lights
Of Liberty alone;
  Here, with God's aid,
Conquered the wilderness,
  Secured their rights.
Not men, but giants, they,
  Who wrought with toil
And sweat of brawn and brain
  Their freehold here;
Who, with their blood, each day
  Hallowed the soil,
And left it without stain
  And without fear.
              2
