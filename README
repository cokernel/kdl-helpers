===========

This is a collection of utilities for generating AIPs, DIPs, and 
such for digital libraries/digital repositories hosted by the
University of Kentucky Libraries.

It requires some scripts to prepare map tiles suitable for 
the Google Maps API.  They aren't currently included in this 
package.
